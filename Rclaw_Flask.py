#Made 30/10/2016
#Roboclaw stuff was copy pasted from Sam's code
#Using python web flask framework, html and javascript and a little jquery
#THIS DOES NOT HAVE PROXIMITY SENSING YET SO PROCEED WITH CAUTION
#WORK LEFT: Adding sqlite to fetch proximity readings from the Monitor_values table in t7.db and use that as argument to limit motion of the tank
#VERY IMPORTANT: BEFORE RUNNING THIS MAKE SURE ALL THE ROOT WEBPAGE ADDRESS IN THIS CODE MATCHES WITH THE pi's IP ADDRESS
#Place Rclaw_Flask.py inside /home/pi AND create a folder inside /home/pi called templates and place Rclaw_main.html in there
#Run Rclaw_Flask.py from linux command terminal to run this program
#To activate the voice rec stuff add Google_Speech_API.html in the templates folder and edit it in on line 44 instead of Rclaw_main.html

#Importing all the relevant stuff
